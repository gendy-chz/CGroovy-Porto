      lyrics: `I carved my name into your ribcage
We talked of lands away from this cage
You said, "Don't fret love, someday I'll be my own man, I'll be free"
Oh, but darlin' did you mean, darlin', did you mean free from me?

You promised home
The kind I'd never known, oh
But here we are, skin and flesh and beating hearts
And I'm wondering what the hell I'm doing wrong

You said, "Let's make ourselves our very own brigade
This love our shield, our blade"
Oh, but darlin', do you see the cuts from which I bleed?
It's me you've slain

I didn't obliterate these walls for you
To come and raid my home
And here you are right next to me
Ironically, I've never felt more alone

I fell for you faster than I fell apart
And I guess I'm the one to blame
For letting myself fall too hard
I ripped my heart out and put it in your hands
In hopes that we'd put up a fight

How paradoxical
Since now all I can think about
Is when will we stop trying
Oh

Oh-oh-oh
How do we stay afloat?
When do I let go?

All you do is blindside me, it's hard to be brave
But when the night cuts into the day, it's your love I crave
I must've thanked my lucky stars too much
They left me sitting in too much dust, mmm, oh

You know all my dreams
You were one, so it seemed
And I love you but with you
It's heartache I breathe
You gave it your all
Just with everything you took from me

Oh, my love
Is this the end for us?
Maybe we've had enough`,

Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were goin'

Now, Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I buried my faith with you
I'm screamin' at a God I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do

I'm still holdin' on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye, 'cause this one means forever
And now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers

Oh, it hurts so hard
For a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart
And left the rest in pieces

Diggin' through your old birthday letters
A crumpled 20 still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last 20 that I've got, oh

I'm still holdin' on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye, 'cause this one means forever
And now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers

Oh, it hurts so hard

You took the best of my heart

Kau masih senang di luar
Ku sudah tenang dikamar

Rindu kita bertengkar

Terang disana cepat
Disini gelap
Ku masih tertidur lelap
Hanya bisa berharap
Engkau disana
Baik baik saja

Menangis terluka di payung rindu
Apa ada yang bisa ambil peranku
Menjaga dirimu, yang kini tak di tanganku

Pagi kita juga beda
Enam jam lebih lama hangatku tiba
Ku baru membuka mata
Kau sudah makan kedua
Gelisah siapa yang tanya
Rindu kita bersama

Kau masih tertidur dengan lelap

It's worse to be nothing

No matter how long I resist temptation
I will always lose

I've done the math, there's no solution
We'll never last
Why can't I let go of this?

I called you last night
I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have

But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you, but I'm super shy, super shy

And I wanna go out with you, where you wanna go? (Huh?)
Find a lil' spot, just sit and talk
Looking pretty, follow me, 우리 둘이 나란히
보이지? 내 눈이 갑자기 빛나지 when you say I'm your dream

You don't even know my name, do you?
You don't even know my name, do you?
누구보다도

I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time

I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you, but I'm super shy, super shy

나 원래 말도 잘하고 그런데 왜 이런지?
I don't like that
Something odd about you, yeah, you're special and you know it
You're the top, babe

I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you, but I'm super shy, super shy

I'm super shy, super shy

떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time

You don't even know my name, do you?
You don't even know my name, do you?
누구보다도

You don't even know my name (super shy, super shy)
Do you? (Make you mine, make you mine)
You don't even know my name (you're on my mind all the time, I wanna tell you)
Do you? (But I'm super shy, I'm super shy)`,

I see you
It always comes around as I believed

When the rain stops
You shine on me
Your light's the only thing that keeps the cold out

Moon in the summer night
Whispering of the stars
They're singing like Christmas trees for us

So I'll tell you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside

And I'll tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are

It's such a strange thing to do
Sometimes I don't understand you
But it always brings me back
To where you are

혹시 아니?
너에겐 나만 아는 모습이 있어
한여름 밤 오는 첫눈같이
믿기지 않는 기적 같은 놀라운 순간, 넌

마음이 날아다녀도
기다릴게
